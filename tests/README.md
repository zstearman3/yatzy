Hi!To run the tests, open your terminal and make your way into this directory. You'll want to be sure your `hands.py`, `dice.py`, and `scoresheets.py` files are in this directory (or move these two test files into your `yatzy` directory).

Then run the following code:


```
$ python -m unittest discover tests
```
