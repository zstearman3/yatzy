Hi!

To run the tests, open your terminal and make your way into this directory. You'll want to be sure your `hands.py`, `dice.py`, and `scoresheets.py` files are in this directory (or move these two test files into your `yatzy` directory).

Then run the following code:


```
$ python -m unittest test_dice.py
$ python -m unittest test_hands.py
```

Any tests that fail will be printed to the screen. Change your code to make the tests pass. Run the tests every time you change something in your code.

Have fun and good learning!
